              My name is John and living the simple life saved my life.
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong> I used to be a pack rat</strong>.I had so many things
              that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
              appreciate any of it because there was too much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
              didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship
            </p>
            <h3 style="color: #1792D2; margin:1.2em 0 .5em 0;">How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of breakdowns when i get rid of everything</strong>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
            <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked</p>
            <h3 style="color: #1792D2; margin:1.2em 0 .5em 0;">
                Now i live the simple life
            </h3>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy</p>
            <p>With how much it turned my life around,<strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
